# fossclub

fossclub is a rewards platform for FOSS Contributors.
It acts as a centralized platform for companies and individuals who want to give out monetary and
non-monetary rewards to contributors based on some decided criterion - say, maintainer
of a project with 100+ stars, or contributor to one of Facebook's open source projects, or a maintainer of a particular
repo, could be anything arbitrary. Contributors can sign up on the platform and start claiming perks that they are
eligible for.

These perks don't have to be high commitment such as cash, but can instead be anything that developers will
appreciate - conference passes, schwag, early access, crypto, cloud credits, or a free coffee.

### What problem does this solve?

With the recent debates around the underappreciation of FOSS, and the "exploitation" of FOSS by companies
without giving back. While FOSS does indeed seem to be underappreciated by the industry, we have to ask
if there is an easy platform for these companies to give back to FOSS. Programs like GitHub Sponsors,
Gitcoin and most others only target singular developer and projects leaving out the rest of the community
at large.

Even if a company like Microsoft decides to start a program for giving back to FOSS with various perks,
they would have to build a platform from scratch. That's what Sindre Sorhus and the devprotocol team did
some time ago when they were giving out some crypto coins based on the GitHub history of the developers.

Can we make a platform that will make it easy for small/large companies to support FOSS without as much
commitment?

### Approach

We wanted to make a platform that will allow any organisation to set an arbitrary set of conditions with
regards to the FOSS contributions of a developer. That is why, we built a system that uses badges which
can be set to track arbitrary metrics from a contributor's FOSS history. The developer-facing platform
is gamified with badges and rewards so that developers try to maximize their FOSS activity.
