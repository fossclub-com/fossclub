# fossclub

fossclub is a rewards platform for FOSS Contributors. It acts as a centralized platform for companies and individuals
who want to give out monetary and non-monetary rewards to contributors based on some decided criterion - say, maintainer
of a project with 100+ stars, or contributor to one of Facebook's open source projects, or a maintainer of a particular
repo, could be anything arbitrary. Contributors can sign up on the platform and start claiming perks that they are
eligible for.

These perks don't have to be high commitment such as cash, but can instead be anything that developers will
appreciate - conference passes, schwag, early access, crypto, cloud credits, or a free coffee.
